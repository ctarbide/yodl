Creating the macros
-------------------

Macros for the man- and manual-pages are different from the macros that will
eventually be stored in, e.g., /usr/share/yodl (the . The former use locally
available information. 

STD_INCLUDE is determined from tmp/wip/config.h, which is available after
build programs.

The macros for the man- and manual-pages are created under 
        tmp/wip/macros, 

the macros that are part of the installation are created by 'build macros' in 
        tmp/install/$STD_INCLUDE

Stamps:
    tmp/man-stamp           - the manual pages were successfully built
    tmp/macros-stamp        - the macros for $STD_INCLUDE were built
    tmp/man-macros-stamp    - the macros for the man(ual) were built
    tmp/macrolist-stamp     - the documentation of the raw macros was written
                              to tmp/wip/macrolist.yo
