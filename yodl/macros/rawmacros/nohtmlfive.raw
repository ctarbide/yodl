macro(nohtmlfive())
 (Starting yodl 3.05 html-conversions by default use html5. This can be
suppressed (in favor of using html4) by calling this macro. This macro merely
suppresses writing the initial tt(<!DOCTYPE html>) to generated html
files; it is only active in the preamble and is only interpreted for
html conversions.
