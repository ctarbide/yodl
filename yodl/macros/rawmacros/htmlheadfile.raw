macro(htmlheadfile(file))
 (Adds the contents of tt(file) to the tt(head) section of an HTML
document. The contents of file are not interpreted and should contain plain
html text. This option can be useful when large bodies of text, like the
contents of tt(<script>) sections, must be included into the head section of
html documents. This macro is only active in the preamble, should only
specified once, and is only interpreted for html conversions.
